The best way to do this is with an “onboarding” process for new members. Your goal is to create a series of touch points (probably an email campaign) that tells people why the community is important and guides them through creating a profile and posting their first message. An “introduce yourself” forum is a great place for people to start. If you can, give people hard numbers. For example, we know that people who participate in our forums are more likely to succeed at building a business, and more likely to earn higher incomes from their businesses than people who do not participate in the forums. Basically, tell your new members what’s in it for them.
Most forum software packages have advanced features that are key to getting the most out of participating in a community. Notifications, search, private messaging, signatures and other features might seem self-explanatory to you, but many people have never used forums before. Sending weekly summaries of the best posts and accomplishments from your community is a great way to keep people coming back, and to encourage them to make progress themselves.
Here’s another simple one that can easily get overlooked. Forum notifications are important to let people know when there is activity on one of their posts or comments. I’m always annoyed by forums that don’t notify me of new comments, because it’s easy to forget about something you posted and never come back to look for replies.
Email is an important piece of your forum strategy. When people first sign up, checking in with your forum won’t be in their daily routine. You’ll need to pull them back, and email is the best tool for that.
Another handful tip is to require real names and photos this will encourage people to be open and honest in the messages boards. Track key members on how much the post, look at how many people are posting per week and see the members with forum profiles.
